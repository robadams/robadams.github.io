<h1> Hello! </h1>

<p>
Let me introduce myself. My name is Rob and I am a sofware developer focused on web development. I have worked across the entire web stack to provide front-end and back-end development along with database and system administration.
</p>

<p>
I spent a couple of years in Cleveland, OH where I graduated from Case Western Reserve University before moving to the NYC area. Most recently I have been involved in two start ups - eFuneral.com and MeeGenius.com. Below are some screen shots of the companies and products that I have had a hand in building.
</p>

<h3> MeeGenius.com </h3>

<p>
MeeGenius provides a digital e-book platform for kids through their web, iOS, Android, and Windows apps.
